"""Shared-memory transport stub.

Reserved for a future low-latency same-host backend. Not implemented because
the QMT runtime ships Python 3.6, where ``multiprocessing.shared_memory`` is
unavailable (added in 3.8). A ``mmap``-plus-named-mutex implementation is
possible but non-trivial; until it lands, selecting this transport raises a
clear error so misconfiguration fails fast.
